Final Project for EN605.425 - Probabilistic Graphical Models

### Requirements:
<ul>
  <li>Python 2.7</li>
  <li>NumPy</li>
  <li>SciPy</li>
  <li>Pandas 0.13</li>
  <li>bayesian (eBay BN module, available at: https://github.com/eBay/bayesian-belief-networks)</li>
</ul>

Assuming that tha above is installed, you can go ahead and run the file ```rb_2013_backcast.py```.  Please don't be startled if this takes *forever*.  The computational complexity of the domain given the sheer number of runningbacks that you can potentially use (ever runningback that has started in an NFL game since 2008) is massive.

This will produce an individual forecast by week of the regular season for 2013.  This is designed to be used in the weekly fantasy auctions where you buy a runningback every week and are not stuck with one guy for the entirety of the season.  Basically, you'll see which running back maximizes the probability of a high (discretized) fantasy score.

The code that autogenerated the rb_bn.py file relies heavily on the .bif parser that is included in the package, although you should not need to run this unless you want to produce an updated .bif file for subsets of the training data.
